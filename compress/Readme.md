# Kata
Compress a given string by replacing repeating characters by their count.
E.g. 'AAABCC' becomes '3A1B2C'.
If the resulting string is longer or equally long as the input, return the input as it would not compress the length of the string overall.


# Rules
- There will be only uppercase letters.
- You can disregard whitespaces (won't occur).
- Input will always contain at least one letter.

# Priority
1. Fastest run time
2. Least used memory
3. Human readable code
