# Kata
Reorder all integers in an array in a way a pendulum would swing.
The smallest element comes in center position (center position = (length of array - 1) / 2).
The first swing goes out to the right.

Examples:
input [2,5,3,3] becomes [3,2,3,5]
input [1,2,3] becomes [2,1,3]

# Priority
1. Fastest run time
2. Least used memory
3. Human readable code
